 * A GridGraph is a graph where vertices can be arranged in a grid
 * and no pair of edges will cross one another (it is planar).
 *
 * We can use a GridGraph to represent a maze either by representing
 * the corridors of the maze or the walls of the maze.  The
 * GridGraph representing the walls of the maze should be one row
 * taller and one row wider than the GridGraph representing the
 * corridors of the maze.
 *
 * Given a grid with height h and width w, there are w*h vertices.
 * A vertex may be connected with edges to the vertices to the
 * north, south, east and/or west (assuming such vertices exist).
 * Edges are undirected, so if vertex 0 is adjacent to vertex 1,
 * the graph should also report that vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 0.
